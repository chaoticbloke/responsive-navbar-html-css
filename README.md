# Responsive navbar html css with toggle (using js)

### Some Notes:

## Block-level Elements.
> Eg: div, article, main,li,hr,footer,video,main,p,section,table.headings etc

#### A block-level element always starts on a new line.
#### A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
#### A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

>  &lt;div&gt; hello. starts new line . takes full width available &lt;/div&gt;


## Inline Elements.
> Eg: span,a,button,br,i,image,input,label,select,input,small,img, textarea etc

#### An inline element does not start on a new line.
#### An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

> &lt;span&gt;hi i am span. dont start with new line nor take full width &lg; /span&gt;
